                  <p class="pt-2">As energy storage is deployed to replace higher capacity factor conventional generation, absorb more extended periods of renewable over generation, and support resilience during severe weather events, there is a potential need for more extended duration storage. ROVI, the proposed initiative from DOE's national labs, seeks to close that information gap by using machine learning and artificial intelligence to model the performance of different long-duration storage technologies, including predicting how the technology will lose performance or hold up physically over time. The initiative would rely on industry data and digital twins of the storage systems for long-term model performance.</p>

                  <p class="pt-2">Solutions to climate change will require the mass deployment of constant power energy technologies and infrastructure. A knowledgeable energy workforce is essential for American competitiveness and energy security. Employment projections suggest that the workforce must expand rapidly to meet the increasing demand for constant power energy technologies. In the short term, federal stimulus investments will boost demand for skilled workers and new trainees, while investments in research and development and efficiency-related technologies will create new employment and business opportunities. Additional study and action are needed to identify the energy efficiency sector's specific skills, education requirements, and employment demands. Expanding regional and state education and training capacity to support new growth in clean energy efficiency is warranted, but efforts to enhance or expand the existing education and training infrastructure should be based on systematic data and input from the industry. There is a need to</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><p>Create new clean energy-related courses, certificates, and degree programs and enhance existing programs to boost education and training system capacity.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Raise the visibility of clean energy manufacturing careers and educational opportunities among youth and job seekers to expand the future workforce pipeline.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Support the development of an industry and labor market information system that provides high-quality data for clean energy efficiency-related labor markets, education and training opportunities, and employment.</p></li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="pt-2">Securing domestic constant power energy systems would require a buildout of local manufacturing, which would be hard-pressed to catch up to the massive factory capabilities already up and running in Asia. Even if that could happen, the newfound American producers would still need to get their hands on the raw materials and process them into industrial feedstocks. Domestic manufacturing could revolutionize electricity generation and delivery in America. Cost-effective, large-scale constant power energy systems could change how we power our homes, reduce infrastructure improvement costs, and allow renewable energy to add power to the electric grid without compromising reliability or increasing consumer costs.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic pt-2">What incentives/programs exist or can be put in place to encourage and foster the U.S. supply chain development and manufacturing for different energy storage?</h3>
                    
                    <p class="pt-2">The challenges are immense for the United States related to raw material availability; manufacturing capacity; dependence on foreign supplies; worker training; global trade practices; cybersecurity; and research and data analysis needed to create the clean energy economy we need. But the opportunities to address the energy supply chain are also immense for the American people: millions of family-sustaining clean energy jobs spread throughout the country; world-class training and research; access to clean and lower-cost energy for all Americans, including those who have been historically left behind; a more resilient American economy for the long term; and an energy system that protects our climate.</p>

                    <p>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued two notices of intent to provide $2.91 billion to boost the production of the advanced batteries critical to rapidly growing clean energy industries of the future, including electric vehicles and energy storage, as directed by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Department intends to fund battery materials refining and production plants, battery cell and pack manufacturing facilities, and recycling facilities that create good-paying clean energy jobs. The funding is expected to be made available in the coming months. It will ensure that the United States can produce batteries and materials that go into them to increase economic competitiveness, energy independence, and national security.</p>
                        
                    <p>In June 2021, DOE published a 100-day review of the large-capacity-battery supply chain under Executive Order 14017, America's Supply Chains. The review recommended establishing domestic production and processing capabilities for critical materials to support an entirely domestic end-to-end battery supply chain. President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocates nearly $7 billion to strengthen the U.S. battery supply chain, which includes producing and recycling critical minerals without new extraction or mining and sourcing materials for domestic manufacturing.</p>
                        
                    <p>With the global lithium-ion battery market expected to proliferate over the next decade, DOE is making it possible for the United States to be prepared for market demand. Responsible and sustainable domestic sourcing of the critical materials used to make lithium-ion batteries — such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite — will help close the gap in supply chain disruptions and accelerate battery production in America.</p>

                    <p class="pt-2">As more individuals and companies utilize constant power energy technologies and other distributed energy resources, and so many of these resources connect to the power grid, there is a growing concern among utility companies about potential cyber-attacks. When constant power energy devices are connected to the power grid, utility companies have less control over these distributed resources' operation, which puts public infrastructure at risk. Smart Grid design and deployment must consider the current cyber vulnerabilities in the power grid. There must be a coordinated and ongoing effort to secure that includes the full development lifecycle. The development life cycle includes requirements, design, implementation, verification, validation, procurement, installation, operations, and maintenance. A failure in any phase of the lifecycle leads to defects, which lead to vulnerabilities that a skilled attacker can exploit. Incentives should be established that encourage vendors and power companies to emphasize security sufficiently.</p>

                    <p class="pt-2">Clean energy industries – such as efficiency, automotive, and construction – would require a further 16 million workers. This means more than 30 million jobs could be created in clean energy, efficiency, and low-emissions technologies by 2030. These include freshly created jobs, for example, due to efficiency upgrades. They also include new roles for existing workers in construction, manufacturing emissions-reducing products like E.V.s and hyper-efficient appliances, and innovative technologies such as hydrogen.</p>

                    <p class="pt-2">Stagnant earnings and growing inequality in the U.S. labor market reflect both a slowdown in worker skills and the matching of good-paying jobs to skilled workers. Improving the ties between colleges, workforce institutions, and employers would help more workers gain the needed skills. Evaluation evidence shows that training programs linked to employers and good-paying jobs are often cost-effective. Helping more states develop such programs and systems would help raise worker earnings and reduce inequality.</p>

                    <p class="pt-2">Under a 100% renewable energy scenario, metal requirements could rise dramatically. It is expected that with the renewable energy transition, renewable energy technologies will consume a growing share of the metals. This growth in demand will significantly influence overall market dynamics, including influencing prices, which may provide feedback to efforts to reduce the material intensity and invest in reuse and recycling infrastructure or promote responsible sourcing.</p>

                    <p>Transparency in the supply chain remains a challenge, particularly for metals such as lithium that are sold in private transactions. We need to engage in responsible sourcing and certification. The industry experts interviewed felt they are more cautious as they are concerned about getting adequate supply volumes from responsibly sourced mines.</p>
                        
                    <p>To move towards a clean and sustainable future, battery manufacturers must be distanced from problematic mining practices. One approach to this has been the development of alternative technology to substitute some of these metals for materials that can be more ethically sourced.</p>
                        
                    <p>To stem the flow of conflict minerals, the United States issued a provision on conflict minerals in 2010, requiring specific disclosures for companies importing 3TG from the DRC and neighboring countries to ensure they are not funding armed groups or human rights abuses.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic pt-2">How can 41001 energy storage programs be strategically deployed to best support communities or regions transitioning from fossil fuels?</h3>
                    
                    <p class="pt-2">Fossil fuels create a sizable economic footprint in the communities where resource extraction, refining, and electricity generation occur. Despite ongoing employment declines in some regions, these and other traditional energy industries still provide many workers with specialized experience and foster careers in the skilled trades. They can offer higher pay with lower formal educational requirements—similar to many other infrastructure-related jobs. And since fossil fuel industries produce and distribute energy goods nationally and globally, they bring income and tax revenues into the community and create downstream jobs, from parts suppliers to teachers and doctors. The U.S. transition to a low-carbon economy is already underway, and some of the most remarkable progress is within the energy-generation sector. As the cost of solar, wind and other renewable sources continues to fall, market forces will continue to encourage renewable energy generation and lead to the closure of fossil fuel extraction and generation activities. A moral and economic imperative exists to help those people and places transition to a clean economy. Fortunately, the geography of clean energy nicely aligns with fossil fuel jobs. Federal officials now have a grand opportunity to leverage this geographic good fortune, deploying public policy to help those communities transition to a clean energy future and using those geographic targets to break the stalemate in our climate politics.</p>

                    <p>First, the federal government must establish clear goals, metrics, and standards to assist workers in economically at-risk communities. Like President Joe Biden's January executive order on climate accounting, the federal government must understand how much each American society can gain or lose within the clean energy transition.</p>
                        
                    <p>Second, the federal government should incentivize targeted training efforts in the "Goldilocks" communities: those currently reliant on fossil fuel industries and have strong potential to generate energy from renewables. Building on the growing evidence of which workforce development efforts are most effective in the energy sector, the federal government should support partnerships among educational institutions, labor, and other community organizations in those regions. Where possible, the federal government should tap the transferable technical skills among current fossil fuel workers; however, it should also acknowledge that the current labor demand for fast-growing renewable energy jobs may still lag behind fossil fuel industries in the next few years and may not supplant all existing jobs. As in any labor market transition, there will be an ebb and flow in hiring needs and training demands.</p>
                        
                    <p>Third, the federal government and its state partners should work directly with local and national companies to ensure investments occur in the "Goldilocks" communities when possible. For example, the federal government could target subsidized loans in these regions to incentivize private investment. Public programs to modernize transmission networks or experiment with large-scale battery storage could start with these locations. Finally, the federal government could increase investment in local research institutions to steer innovation activities to these places.</p>

                    <p class="pt-2">The USA's constant electric power energy devices situation has been a paradox. While Americans have struggled to secure sufficient battery supply, investments in power energy devices have been concentrated in Asia. Should constant electric power energy manufacturing be installed in the USA, it would bring considerable advantages to USA's economic, industrial, and sustainability efforts. To address local supply chain, consumption, and pollution issues and for the Biden administrations clean energy vision, we aim to establish constant electric power energy devices Implementation business with public-private partnership. Our partnership with manufacturers to develop constant electric power energy devices across the USA will provide millions of job opportunities and create a sustainable job environment. We will be implementing and structuring Constant electric power energy device systems that will grow the renewable energy devices manufacturing capacity in the USA. High energy density, low maintenance, and high performance is the significant advantage of our constant electric power energy devices. We will continuously invest in R&D to further improve our constant electric power energy devices. We aim to promote the green economy initiative by implementing and structuring the "Constant electric power energy" industry.</p>
